            <p><strong>Lol</strong>, randomly I started giving you company for <strong>walking</strong>, and honestly, I enjoyed that <strong>first walk</strong> as you talked a lot and got me shocked. Days passed… from just walking together, we started buying groceries, watching movies, and <strong>chit-chatting about random topics for hours and hours.</strong></p>
    
            <p>And then, somewhere along the way, I realized...<br>
            There was something <strong>beyond friendship</strong> between us.</p>
    
            <p>I still remember you saying that you <strong>explicitly drop hints</strong> when you have feelings for someone, but it took me a while to realize that those hints… were for me. 🙈💜</p>
    
            <p><strong>Lucky me</strong> that you didn’t wait for me to figure it out—you took the initiative yourself. You came up to me and wrote me a <strong>letter so full of emotions</strong> that it made me blush. <strong>Till then, I didn’t even know I had the capacity to blush!</strong> 😳💖</p>
    
            <p>And from <strong>May 29, 2024</strong>, until now, I would say:</p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>We had <strong>arguments</strong>, but we never gave up. 💪</li>
                <li>We had <strong>fights</strong>, but we never gave up. 🥺</li>
                <li>We had <strong>misunderstandings</strong>, but we never gave up. 💜</li>
                <li>You never once <strong>lowered the way you cared for me</strong>—you always made sure I was okay. ❤️</li>
                <li>Whenever I was down, <strong>you lifted me up.</strong> 😊</li>
                <li>Whenever I was confused, <strong>you guided me back to the right path.</strong> 🚦</li>
                <li>When people tried to <strong>speak badly about me</strong>, you shut them down with your sharp words. 😎💜</li>
                <li>You <strong>drove me everywhere</strong>, you taught me how to drive. 🚗</li>
                <li>Well, <strong>now it’s my turn to drive you.</strong> 🚗💜</li>
                <li>Or maybe… <strong>let’s just drive together, forever.</strong> 💑</li>
            </ul>
